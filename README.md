# Godot RL Agents
The Godot RL Agents is a fully Open Source packages that allows video game creators, AI researchers and hobbiest the opportunity to learn complex behaviors for their Non Player Characters or agents. 
This repository provides:
* An interface between games created in Godot and Machine Learning algorithms running in Python
* Access to 21 state of the art Machine Learning algorithms, provided by the [Ray RLLib](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/rllib-algorithms.html) framework.
* Support for memory-based agents, with LSTM or attention based interfaces
* Support for 2D and 3D games
* A suite of AI sensors to augment your agent's capacity to observe the game world
* Godot and Godot RL agents are completely free and open source under the very permissive MIT license. No strings attached, no royalties, nothing.

### Motivation
Over the next decade, advances in AI algorithms notable in the fields of Machine Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning are primed to revolutionize the Video Game industry. Customizable enemies, worlds and story telling will lead to diverse gameplay experiences and new genres of games. Currently the field is dominated by large organizations and pay to use engines that have the budget to create such AI enhanced agents. The objective of the Godot RL Agents package is to lower the bar of accessability so that game developers can take their idea from creation to publication end-to-end with an open source and free package.
### Citing Godot RL Agents

### Installation
Godot RL agents requires current support Linux development and requires python 3.6, if you are new to python, we strongly recommend using conda
### Examples
We provide several reference implementations and instructions to implement your own environment, plesae refer to the examples document.
